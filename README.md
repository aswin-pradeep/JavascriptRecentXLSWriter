# JavascriptRecentXLSWriter
Code Snippet to demonstrate XLS most recent added file's cell write operation using Javascript's ActiveXObject.
# This takes a directory as input
# Please make sure you use Internet Explorer as Chrome blocks JS having ActiveXObject since the front end JS code should not access files in the Running Machine.
# Using this snippet a HTML form can be developed which can CRUD data on to XLS just like updating DB.
